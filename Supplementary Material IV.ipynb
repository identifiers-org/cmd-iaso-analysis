    "We can now use `cmd-iaso`'s interactive curation to walk us through the issues it has identified. We will use the `scheme-only-redirect`, `ssl-error` and `http-status-error` validators. The first validator finds HTTP redirects which only change the schema but not the rest of the URL. These extraneous redirects could potentially be avoided by updating the `urlPattern` stored in identifiers.org's registry. The second and third validators look for SSL and HTTP error codes in the responses, respectively. You can find their implementations on [GitHub](https://github.com/identifiers-org/cmd-iaso/tree/main/iaso/curation/validators).\n",
